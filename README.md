 Android-SQLiteDatabase-Example-with-ListView
This is an example that allows a user to store a username and score into sqlite database and view in listView

This was created to help others use the SQLiteDatabase within the Android Studio Platform. It is a simple application that will allow for a user to enter in a username and score and click submit. Then click the view Database button and be shown the database in a ListView.
Hope this helps others.
