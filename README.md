Android-SQLiteDatabase-Example-with-ListView
 
This is an example that allows a user to store a username and score into sqlite database and view in listView

This was created to help others use the SQLiteDatabase within the Android Studio Platform. It is a simple application that will allow for a user to enter in a username and score and click submit. Then click the view Database button and be shown the database in a ListView.
Hope this helps others.

***UPDATE***

I added a custom adapter and custom row for better appearance. I also added a custom alert dialog with the ability to delete the selected person in the list. I also created a data provider class to get the sql into object form. I am learning to enhance my abilities and hope this can help others as well. Any feedback is welcomed. Thanks
